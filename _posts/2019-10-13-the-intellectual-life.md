This is almost a review of the book ["The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods"][amazon-associate-en-book-link]. *BEWARE!* I will highligth my personal points of interest with my own words, which makes it highly biased by what makes sense for my own life, this is why I choose calling it "almost a review".

The book was written by Antonin-Gilbert Sertillanges, and first published in 1934, in french. I read a Brazilian-portuguese ebook version titled (["VIDA INTELECTUAL: Seu espírito, suas condições, seus métodos"][amazon-associate-pt-book-link]).

The book aims at providing guidance for those who want to follow an intellectual vocation. It is meant not only for those who want to dedicate their whole life and time to the intellectual work, but also for those who want to reserve some of their time for intellectual studies.

Sertillanges was a catholical priest, so his observations in the book are highly linked to his spiritual life and religiosity, but I consider that his guidance and advices are highly valuable for fulfiling any vocation one may choose (or be chosen for), and specially useful for those who want to stablish a routine of studies or intellectual work.

It may be helpful even if you only want some tips to find the time and motivation to study. Some of his advices may sound a little extreme but the man has some points.

I find useful to try and define here what a vocation is, as hard as it may be. I would define it as something you do that, deeply in your inner self, you can identify as your role in this world, your purpose in life It may be a profession or something else, like being a father or mother. You may not notice or even like your vocation at first, but you may realize it is your vocation as time goes.

There is a documentary on Netflix called "Jiro Dreams of Sushi" that can help in the understanding of what a vocation is. The episode 2 from Season 6 of Netflix's series Chef's Table (Dario Cecchini) is very illustrative as well. 

As I understood it, an intellectual life is a vocation where you aquire knowledge as a way of getting closer and closer to the truth. And as the ultimate truth is God, then you are dedicating your life to God, creating a compatibility between spirituallity and intelectuallity.

Right at the start o the book, he warns the reader that the intellectual vocation can't be achieved by sparse reading and work, and anyone who wants to follow the intellectual vocation must work hard and continously during the time devoted to it.

Chapter 1 - The Intellectual vocation

- A vocation that requires dedication, hard work and heavy obligations.
- Your have to make studying a continuous practice, because aquiring knowledge requires hard work, but it only requires some lack of discipline for one to forget what was learned or lose motivation to work.
- You don't need to be a genius to be successful. Discipline, patience and perseverance can take you high over the average.

Chapter 2 - Virtues of an Intellectual
I - The common virtues
- Ease mind: the mind must be at ease for one to be capable to do intellectual work.
- Purity of soul: Purity of thought requires purity of soul. You will be able to be more focuses on your work if your mind isn't revolving around sentiments like proud, envy or irritation.

II - The virtue proper to the intellectual
- The virtue proper to the man of study is studiousness.
- Don't take it as a simple statement. There is two pitfalls in studiousness: negligence and curiosity. Temperance is the key.
- Too less study and you will not reach your goals.
- Too much study may alienate you. You still have to do your obligations as a human: eat, clean your house, support your family.
- Take care of your body and mental health, in the long term it can become an impeditive. The intellectual journey is a marathon, not a sprint.
- Don't overestimate yourself. Start small to win big, and don't try to skip stages.
  - Be humble and don't waste your precious time, you have much to learn from the ones that came before you. Stand over their shoulders.

IV - The discipline of the body
- The intellect can't be dissociated from the body. A long intellectual life depends on having a healthy body as well.
- Do not be ashamed of taking care of your health. 
  - "Those who do not find time to take exercise must find time to be ill". Do at least a daily exercise session. Some stretches, at least, wont kill you.
  - If you're a programmer, you must have heard of people proud of working long hours and living a sedentary life. Do not fall for it.
- Enjoy the outdoors and nature as much as possible. Intellectuals (and programmers) lack fresh air and vitamin D!
- Watch the ergonomics.
- Schedule vacations at least once a year, and stick to it. 
  - It doesn't mean you should stop your intellectual work, but that your resting time should prevail.
- Look after your diet. The digestion of heavy meals will surely interfere in your thinking.
- Look after your sleeping. 
- In the the question of eating and sleeping, there is no general rule. Experiment what works better for your productivity and then keep it with firm resolution.
- -"Do not turn into a wizened and stunted creature, a failure, who later on might be dull-witted, an old man before his time, and therefore a foolish steward of the talent entrusted to him by the Master".

Chapter 3: The Organization of Life
"You have a difficult journey before you - do not burden yourself with too much baggage"
"When one thinks of a man of genius, one does not imagine him dining out"
Simplify:
- You will be more focused on your work and studies by making your life simpler. 
- Simplify your ambient, obligations, coexistence, etc;
- Save as much time as you can:
  - Have less things.
  - Domestic appliances to save time.
- Save your time and mood by reducing social interactions that do not add anything and we both know you hate (receptions, baby showers and graduations of people you don't know for example).
- The time one expends in unnecessary social events could be of more use by building a personal library, doing a trip, going on vacations.

II. Solitude and cooperation
"You will not be far from your brothers because you have left their noise behind you"
- Solitude for the studies should be top priority in the life organization, everything else should be arranged around it.
  - Stop your internal monologue
- Associate with fellows from who you can learn from and cooperate with, those who share the same life principles you do.
- Try to associate with people that have a superior intellect than you do.
- There are relationship you can't choose. What to do?
    - You can exercise the giving. Learn how to teach them something.
    - Try to speak with moderation, and only the necessary. It helps you achieve the solitude you need, at the same time putting some weigth behind your speak.


Chapter IV
I. The permanent work
- Follow a routine of studies. Two hours a day dedicated to your studies may be enough, if you keep focused. Learn to administer your time.
- Make it a habit. It will require much less will power than doing it sporadically.
- Solitude is good, isolation is bad. Before being an Intellectual, you are a human being. Don't becom an hermit.
- Try to observe and verify in the everyday practice what you learn from the theory.
- Listen to everyone with attention. A hudred number of truths may circle the most simple discourses.
- Of course, staying in a constant state of vigil can be tiresome, altough. It should be faced as an enjoyable habit of curiosity, not a duty.


IV. The working time
- Reserve some time to work
    It depends on your personal obligations androutine.
    Take in consideration the time you feel more productive.
- Once you reserve some time, prepare it so nothing can distract you. Make sure you don't schedule anything to this hours. Protect this time as if your life depended on it.
- Observe your habits and learn how to avoid interruptions. Keep yourself away from the news or any other source of distraction.
- Prepare it so you know right from the start what and how you will do it. If you intend to read certain book, have it in hand. If you want to write something, have the necessary tools prepared.
- Make realistic plans and follow it. Try not to let work unfinished, or you will get yourself thinking about it during the time you should be resting.

II - The work at night
- Use the end of the night to organize your next day and do the burebureaucraticaucrit work or any other non-intellectual work.
- A tired night worker is a bad worker. Sometimes when stuck in a difficult problem, the better option is to sleep.
- Many times the solution will occur you during your sleep or right in the morning, when you get into the problem with a fresh state of mind.
- If an idea occurs in the middle of the night, take some notes and get back to bed, in order to remember it in the morning.

Chapter 5: The field of work
I. Comparative study
- What one studies dependends on one's personal vocation and the traced objective, but there are some general advices.
- When studying a subject, one should study every specific discipline connected to it in a more superficial manner, sticking to the essential, and try to connect it to the any more general discipline available. Then get deeper in the specific disciplines as much as you find necessery.
- Organize a plan for your study, the order of studies and timeboxes should no be random.
- This approach will not slow your progress, in the contrary, accessing the center of an idea will make everything else easier to understand.
- Sertillanges say that every science explored to its maximum would take you to the other sciences, all the scieces woult take to poetry, the poetry and the sciences would take to the morality, then politics and religion.
- As a tip for those who want to learn theology: Dedicate 4 weekly hours fr five or six years. After that you only have to maintain it. Study the Summa Theologica, by Saint Thomas Aquinas. Have the Catechism of the Council of Trent at hand.

II. Thomism, the ideal framewortk for knowledge
- The ideal framework for the Comparative study, according to Sertillanges, is the Thomism. It is a school of philosophy that tries to concile the Aristotelic philosophy with christianism (according to wikipedia).

III. Our specialty
- it is necessary to understand everything, but with the the objective of being able to do something.
- One should be a generalist with the objective of becoming a cultured person, but a specialist in iorder to execute a function and having a good performance.
- One has to decide how much he is willing to dedicate to the generalist studies and how much to its own specialty.
- Once you know your vocation, you sure should get deeper on your specialty. The spirit needs an increasing level of challenge in order to keep its interest.

IV. The necessary sacrifices
- "It is a painful thing to say to oneself: by choosing one road I am turning my back on a thousand others."
- Know were to set the limits of your studies. Kknow what you decided to focus and what you will only get an idea. Other people will do what you don't.

Chapter VI: The spirit of work
I. Ardor in research
- Be curious. As much as possible, don't let without solution or conclusion any of the work and investigations you do during the research.
- The greatest enemy of the knowledge is our indolence. Do not accept giving the maximum only here and there. It is easy for us to think of an intense and constant work pace as a martyrdom.
- An authentic thinker approaches his work with a spirit of a conqueror, with almost an heroic inspoiration. A Hero does not stay sit and does not pose himself limits.

II. Concentration
- Avoid mulktitasking. Dedicate all your resources to a single task at hand and then move on. The change of context does not produce giid results, it will break ones spirit.
- You should instead follow a path vigorously, taking breaks for rest when you finish each phase of the work. This way you will keep your mind fresh and your courage immaculated.

III. Submission to the truth
- The intellectual accepts only the truth and nothing less. He is not a skeptycal - a skeptycal would question even the obvious truth when he finds it.
- The truth only reveals itself fot those who keep an open mind to seek it even when he think he knows the answer, and the humbleness to accept the truth when he finds it, even whe it goes against his assumptions or comes from some unexpected sources.
- I understand that the study requires the same kind of "flow" a developer can achieve when programming. It is a state of steadfast focus where you don't even see time passing.

IV. Breadth of outlook
- Keep the big picture. If you go deept in an aspect of a problem, always try to get back and imagine how it fits in the whole system.
- Enrich your work by including the related subjects to your main point.

V. The sense of mystery

Chapter VII: Preparatino for work
- Working means learning e producing. Both require long preparations.
    - To produce you have to learn first.
    - To learn a complex subject, you have do a whole processing starting with the simple and increasing 
    in complexity.

A - The reading
I. Not reading much
- Knowing how to read is primordial.
- You should not read much.
- It means you should read intelligently, select a reading list and stick to the essentials. You don't have all the time in the world.
- A good reader reads, retains and organize only what he is seeking for.

II. Choose
- Choose which books to read and what to read in them. 
- Men can flawed, corrupted, dishonest. Remember the same can be true about the books they write.
- In this mattter, take the advice of mentors and trustful advisors.
- Take from the sources. Associate yourself only with the elite of the thinkers, and favor the original authors of the ideas.
- Ignore works not well done. They were probably not well thought as well.
- Read everything that is good, without prejudice, but love the eternal books, those who enclose eternal truths.
- Stablish a plan of studies considering the subjects and a progression of complecity.

III. Four kinds of readings
There are four kinds of readings
- To read for having a formation and be someone: the fundamental readings
- To read in face of a task in hand: the ocasional readings
- To read as a training for your work and for the good: the training readings
- To read as a distraction: the relaxing readings

For the fundamental readings, it is recommended to chose a wise mentor and drown in his writings, then keep following the links he gives you.

The ocasional readings are more exploraoty, always with the task in hand to solve. You don't need to read the whole books for this. Just take what you need.

For the training readings your experience must be considered. You are already in your field of knowledge, so you probably don't have to follow a mentor blindly.

For the relaxing reading, you can choose your favorite authors, observe how the reading affect you and keep it close to you as a medicine. You can always read them again when you find it useful. Of course, be wise and choose something that may be can be of any use somehow.

IV Contact with the geniuses
- We, as mere modest thinkers, should enjoy the grace of being able to be in touch with geniuses by the means of their writings.
- The geniuses simplify. They are able to take a complex matter and unveil it in a simple way for the common man.
- We wont speak as geniuses by reading them, but we can at least borrow their accent.

V. Concile, istead of opose
- To take advantage of the readings, it is useful to try to conciliate the different authors, to find a conducting wire that links all of them togheter. There is probably some truth in what all these author agree.
- When searching for the truth, there is no need to elect a winner beforehand. You can read all the authors and then use your judgement to decide what points each one got right.

VI Appropriate and live
- The main purpose of reading is to aproppriate of the true ideas and compose your thinking on top of that, maybe to use it in practice.
- Books are just a bunch of pages with letters in it. We have to comprehend all those writings and transform it in a way our brain is able to comprehend and store. We have to get a deeply understaind of the authors's ideas for that.
- We only truly use the readings when we make use the knowledge we got to change ourselves, to use that in practice or to produce something base on it.

B - The organization of the memory
I. What is necessary to memorize
- Reading would not be of any use if we could not memorize it.
- We should focus on memorizing only what is useful to us at the moment. You can re-read a book in the future if necessary.

II. In what order to memorize
- Try to relate any new knowledge to what you already know, like a graph of subjects. It will be easier to remember it afterwards.

III. How to proceed to memorize.
- Tente criar o grafo de dependências do conhecimento e meditar sobre esses relacionamento. Quando quiser lembra algo, tente buscar um dos conceitos desse grafo e percorrê-lo até encontrar o que deseja.
- Após ler algo que se deseja reter, procure repetir o que fou lido ou dito de forma resumida.
- Medite a respeito do que precisa lembrar o tanto quanto o assunto necessitar.

C- The notes
I. How to take notes
Given we want to not read much and keep in our memory even less, notes are essential. Sertillanges suggests a book of notes or a cards file. Today with blogs and search systems, physical notes may not be of much use.
There is a relevant point altough, which is the kind o preparatino we want to take notes for.
- For the long term: notes done for archiving for consulting it in the future. These will be more general, given you don't know what to expect in the future.
- For immediate usage: notes taken with the purpose of producing something immediately. These will be focused on the task in hand.

Some other guidance for notes
- Create a note only for wha tyou judge useful.
- Avoid too much notes, or you will not be able to finding anything.
- Create the notes as you read.

II. How to classify your notes
Here the author goes throug the system of cards file, using tags to identify each note according to its subject. I guess nowadays it can be replaced by small blog posts, a tagging system and a search engine.

III. How to use your notes
Two ways of using your notes are mentioned, according to how you will organize your work to produce something.
- In the first case, you produce a roadmap with a sequence of predefined subjects that you want to tackle. You will have to search in your annotations everything related to each subject and organize them accordingly to your plan.
- In the second case, you specify a general, broader subject, that you want to remeber and come with a plan afterwards. You will have to select all notes related to he subject, than identify and organize them in smaller, connected subjects, and create a sequence to present them.       

Chapter VIII: The creative work
I. Writing
It is necessary to write during your whole intellectual life. 
- You should write first for yourself, to organize and document your thoughts.
- Then you have to publish in order to imrpove your work based on the public feedback.

- The start is more than half the whole. Moving from inertia is the more difficcult step.
- It is normal to not get it right in the first time. You will only improve if you practice and collect the feedbacks.
- With practice, you will create your own writing style. THe style, according to Sertillanges, is composed by
  - Truth.
  - Individuality.
  - Simplicity.
- The truth in style is when your writing is connected to the reality and one is able to perceive what you write as the truth, as how we do when reading others writings.
- The great style consist in discovering the essential links between the elements of the thought, and in the art of expressing then in the simplest way possible.

II. Detachment from self and the world
- An intellectual must be someone who seek the truth and nothing less, by the means of studying and researching.
- An intellectual must not write to please his writers. His only compromise is with the truth.

III. Be constant, pacient and perseverant
- A life of studies is not easy. It is hard to not lost the focus to the inumerous distractions we have.
- The intellectual work is tiresome to the mind. Stimulants are no good, because it is exhaustive and requires evere increasing doses. Prefer a walking in the outdoors, instead.
- Look at your completed work. It should replenish your animus.
- You should make the study a habit.
- "The works made at the cost of much work should    look like, in despite of the truth, to be easy and conceived effortlessly". Michelangelo

IV. Doing things well and finishidn everything 

- Not finishing a work is the same as destroying it. That's why, before starting to produce something, there should be careful deliberation if it is really worth starting it.
- Giving up can become a habit.
- Do the best you can and make it as perfect as possible. It is not necessary to compose in high quantity.

Chapter IX: The worker and the man

- Character is more important than knowledge. Similarly, your life as a man is more important than your work.
- The study must be useful for the life. It's only purpose is to expand the ourselves. It must not end up shrinking our existence.
- Every specialist is, before all, a human being, and his essence is broader than everything he thinks and does.
- The work is a free act.

II. Knowing how to relax
- The intellectual work should not be excessive, or it will not be benefic in the long term.
- When one does not predict the rest, then he will be forced to rest. It will show in the form of distraction and sleepiness.
- Work hard then relax in short and frequent intervals. Don't try doing both at the same time, or you will do none of them.

III. Accepting our trials
- there will be many trials:
    - your ideal that will appear to be more and more distant, in the measure you realize the vastity of your ignorance.
    - the stupids, who will not comprehend anything you say and will be horiffied by your words.
    - the envyous;
    - the good ones who will let you down
    - the mediocre
- "The true wise man does not argue". Your work will be criticized. The time you would spend defendind yourself is better applied producing a new one.

IV. Appreciate our joys
- The work has its joys. The reward for producing a work is having produced it. The rewatd for the effort is growing up.

V. Looking forward for the fruits
- The culture is not the only child of the geniuses. It is birth from a qualified, organized and continuous work.
